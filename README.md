The repository is for the PHP to Node.JS mentorship.


### Branch name convention

Everyone has it is own *main* branch with their full name (e.g. `ruslan.ustiugov`).
In context of tasks we should create additional branches with this naming convention:
- feature/TICKET-CODE (e.g `feature/PTNJC-6`)
- bug/TICKET-CODE (e.g `bug/PTNJC-6`)
